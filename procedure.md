# Procedure

1. Use sliders to set up the **pendulum length**, **mass**, and **initial angle**.
2. Click the **release** button to observe the pendulum swinging.  
   Data for **angular displacement (θ)**, **velocity (v)**, and **energies (KE, PE, TME)** will be recorded.
3. View **real-time graphs** of:
   - Total Mechanical Energy (TME) vs. time,
   - Kinetic Energy (KE) vs. time,
   - Potential Energy (PE) vs. time.
4. **Verify energy conservation** by checking if the **total mechanical energy (TME)** remains constant throughout the motion.
5. **Adjust inputs** (length, mass, initial angle) and **rerun the simulation** to observe how the behavior changes.
6. **Save graphs and results** for reporting or further analysis.

# Formulae for Simulation

### 1. Height (h)

The vertical height (`h`) of the pendulum bob relative to its lowest point is given by:

<p align="center">
  <strong>h = L(1 - cos(θ))</strong>
</p>

Where:
- `L` = Length of the pendulum (in meters),
- `θ` = Angular displacement (in radians).

### 2. Velocity (v)

The instantaneous velocity (`v`) of the pendulum bob at an angular displacement `θ` is given by:

<p align="center">
  <strong>v = √(2gL(cos(θ) - cos(θ₀)))</strong>
</p>

Where:
- `g` = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²),
- `L` = Length of the pendulum (in meters),
- `θ` = Angular displacement at time `t` (in radians),
- `θ₀` = Initial angular displacement (in radians).
